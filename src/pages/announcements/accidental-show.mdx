## So a room was booked

I don't want to say who accidentally booked it, but now we need 
to do a show I think? I got my soul bound VP Daniel to make a graphic 
so it seems kind of official now. Join us for a show that we will
make up on the spot, not because we can, but because we didn't have the 
time to plan anything else
